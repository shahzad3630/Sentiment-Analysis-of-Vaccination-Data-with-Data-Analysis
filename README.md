<h1>Sentiment Analysis of Vaccination Data with Data Analysis</h1><br><br>

A code to do the sentiment analysis of the vaccination data and later use it to do the data analysis of the unseen data.

<br>
For sentiment analysis, first default NLTK and textblob packages were used to check their performance, but their accuracy were very poor on vaccination data. 
So separate new models were trained using both Machine Learning and Deep Learning models and they were compared against each other. For Deep Learning, transformer 
models were used and for Machine Learning different models were used and their performance were noted.

<br>
At the end, the best model is selected and it is tested on the unseen data for doing the data analysis or text analysis.

<br>
A corresponding report is made and present along side the data and code.
